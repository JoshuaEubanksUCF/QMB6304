# Course Description
This course is designed to introduce you to the main tools of data visualization. Data, especially complex data, are often easier to understand and communicate in a visual form. The process of understanding data, on the way to analyzing it, is called “exploratory data analysis”, and visualization is often an important part of it. Communicating data to others is also best accomplished visually, using similar tools from a different perspective, with an emphasis on best practices to promote a clear understanding by your audience. This course will achieve both goals of data visualization by focusing on the software tools for producing the visualization, guided by the theory for producing effective visualizations. 

There is a lot of different software used in the industry to generate visualizations and the tools vary by organization (https://medium.com/javarevisited/8-best-data-visualization-tools-and-libraries-data-analysts-and-scientists-can-learn-d2734371df16).
